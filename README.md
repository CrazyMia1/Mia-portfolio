Reflection: 
Making my personal information website was a great learning experience. I tried to keep the design clean and easy to use by using the same colors and fonts throughout the site.
I made sure the menu was simple so visitors could easily find sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. I also made the website work well on both computers and phones so everyone can use it easily.

One big problem I had was putting the site online. I kept getting a 404 error, which means the page couldnâ€™t be found. I found out that the files needed to be in the right folders for GitHub Pages to work.
I fixed this by moving my files to the correct places and changing the links to my CSS and JavaScript files. Designing the site was also hard because I wanted it to look nice and work well at the same time.
I tried different layouts and colors until I was happy with it.

In the future, I want to add more fun features like animations and hover effects to make the site more interesting. I also plan to add more details and pictures to the Projects section to show my work better.
Adding a contact form will help visitors reach me easily. I would also like to make the site easier for everyone to use, including people with disabilities. These changes will help make my website better and more professional.
